# KotlinTraining
A bunch of Kotlin Examples for learning

Well well, fancy seeing you here.  You ready to learn what `Kotlin` is all about?

Here's a basic study guide subject to change:

## Lesson 1

- Learn about Kotlin `data class`es
- What makes these unique compared to Java?
- What can we use when calling Kotlin from Java?

### Exercise

- Run the existing unit tests for `PersonTest.kt`
- Implement your own `data class`
- Implement your own Kotlin Unit test
- Implement your own Java Unit test that calls Kotlin
- Construct your class using Named constructor arguments
- Create a function with Nullable type as a parameter in a test
  - Call a method on this object with a nullable type
  - What did you have to do?
  - Try calling the function with null
  - Try calling with an actual object
  - What happens? (Set break points or `print()` to see

### Goals

- Understand what Kotlin data classes do automatically for us
- Understand how to call Kotlin data classes from Java (don’t worry, just works)
- Understand named constructor parameters and what that means for Good Ol’ Builder patterns
- Understand what Non-Nullable and Nullable types are
